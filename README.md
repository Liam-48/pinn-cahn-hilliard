# Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) for Three-Phase Cahn-Hilliard Model

** Work in progress **

This project implements a PINN to solve the three-phase Cahn-Hilliard equation and explores the use of the PINN
to solve the inverse problem for identifying unkown parameters like the free energy functional from experimental
or simulation data.

## To Do

[ ] Implement PINN architecture

[ ] Add training script

[ ] Include results and visualizations

[ ] Compare to finite difference method

[ ] Explore inverse problem capacities
